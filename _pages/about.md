Welcome! I am currently a PhD student of [Yamaguchi Lab](https://www.graco.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/yama-lab/index.php) of Department of General Systems Studies at the University of Tokyo (UTokyo). My research interests include explainable AI, visualization of deep networks, and applications of network interpretability. Although I specialize in software for my research, I also like to work with hardwares for interesting toy projects.
