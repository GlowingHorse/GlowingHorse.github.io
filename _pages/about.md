Welcome! I am Rui Shi (石睿), a lecturer with the School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing University of Technology (北京工业大学). I received my Ph.D. in graphic and computer sciences from the University of Tokyo (东京大学), supervised by Prof. [Yasushi Yamaguchi](https://www.graco.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/yama-lab/index.php), in 2022. I also served as a visiting researcher in the Department of General Systems Studies, the University of Tokyo.

My research interests include explainable and trustworthy AI, interpreting autonomous driving, and applications of network interpretability. Although I specialize in software for my research, I also like to work with some hardwares (Raspberry Pi, depth camera, *etc*) for interesting toy projects.
