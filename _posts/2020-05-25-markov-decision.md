This is an example of Markov decision process for the course CS229. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/GlowingHorse/MarkovDecisionProcess-RobotMoveInBoxes-CS229){: .btn .btn-green}

For me, Markov decision process of CS229's reinforcement learning is the most difficult part to understand. But I believe it can save you a lot of time in understanding this difficult part with this project (robot move in box).
